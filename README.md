# My Dotfiles

- This project is inspired by [michaeljsmalley](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles)
- It is based on this [article](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/).
- The script has been changed to use `.bash_alias` instead of `.bashrc`, as that is the suggested method on debian.
